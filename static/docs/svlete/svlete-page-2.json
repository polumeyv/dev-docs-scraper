  "content": "Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces.  Instead of using a virtual DOM, Svelte compiles your code at build time into small, highly optimized vanilla JavaScript. This means no runtime overhead, less code to download, and faster updates. \n\nYou can use Svelte to build anything on the web, from small interactive components to ambitious full-stack applications.  SvelteKit, Svelte's companion application framework, helps streamline building complex applications. \n\nSvelte's simplicity and performance make it a great choice for developers of all levels.  For beginners, the interactive tutorial provides a gentle introduction to the framework's core concepts.  If you prefer hands-on learning, explore the online playground or StackBlitz.",
