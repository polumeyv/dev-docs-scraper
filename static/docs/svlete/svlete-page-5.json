  "content": "The Svelte command-line interface (CLI), `sv`, is a toolkit for creating and maintaining Svelte applications.\n\nThe easiest way to run `sv` is with `npx` (or your package manager's equivalent, such as `pnpx` for pnpm):\n\n```bash\nnpx sv <command> <args>\n```\n\nIf `sv` is already installed in your project, this will use the local installation; otherwise, it will download the latest version and run it without installing it globally. This is particularly useful for `sv create`.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThank you to Christopher Brown, who originally owned the `sv` name on npm, for graciously allowing its use for the Svelte CLI. You can find the original `sv` package at `@chbrown/sv`.",
