  "content": "Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. \n\nThis means less code to download and run, and faster updates for your users. You can use Svelte to build anything on the web, from standalone components to ambitious full-stack apps (using Svelte’s companion application framework, SvelteKit) and everything in between.  Svelte uses a compiler to transform declarative components written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into lean, tightly optimized JavaScript.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n  function greet() {\n    alert('Welcome to Svelte!');\n  }\n</script>\n\n<button on:click={greet}>Click me</button>\n\n<style>\n  button {\n    font-size: 2em;\n  }\n</style>\n```",
