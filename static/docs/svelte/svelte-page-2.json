  "content": "Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces.  Instead of using a virtual DOM like other frameworks (React, Vue, Angular), Svelte compiles your code at build time into small, highly optimized vanilla JavaScript.  This means less code to download and faster initial load times.  You write your components in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – the same tools you already know – and Svelte takes care of the rest.\n\nYou can use Svelte to build anything on the web, from small interactive components to ambitious full-stack applications using SvelteKit, its companion application framework. \n\nFor beginners, we recommend starting with the interactive tutorial. This documentation serves as a reference for more advanced topics.",

  "summary": "Svelte is a compiler-based web framework that transforms declarative components written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into highly optimized JavaScript code.  It allows building anything from small components to full-stack applications using SvelteKit, offering a lean and performant alternative to traditional frameworks.",
  "keypoints": [
    "Compiler-based: Transpiles components into efficient JavaScript.",
