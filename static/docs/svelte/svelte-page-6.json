  "content": "The Svelte command-line interface (CLI), `sv`, is a toolkit for creating and maintaining Svelte applications.\n\n**Usage**\n\nThe easiest way to run `sv` is with `npx` (or the equivalent command for your package manager, such as `pnpx` for pnpm):\n\n```bash\nnpx sv <command> <args>\n```\n\nIf you're inside a project where `sv` is already installed, this will use the local installation; otherwise, it will download the latest version and run it without installing it. This is particularly useful for `sv create`.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nThank you to Christopher Brown, who originally owned the `sv` name on npm, for graciously allowing it to be used for the Svelte CLI. You can find the original `sv` package at [@chbrown/sv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chbrown/sv).",
