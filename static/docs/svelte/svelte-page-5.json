  "content": "## Introduction to Svelte and SvelteKit\n\nIf you're new to Svelte or SvelteKit, we recommend starting with the interactive tutorial.  For assistance, join the Discord chatroom.\n\n### What is Svelte?\n\nSvelte is a compiler that transforms your UI components (like navigation bars or forms) into highly optimized JavaScript and CSS.  This allows for efficient rendering in the browser. While you don't need to know Svelte to understand this guide, familiarity will be helpful.  Learn more with the Svelte tutorial.\n\n### What is SvelteKit?\n\nSvelteKit is a framework for building complete web applications using Svelte.  It provides a structured approach to development, offering features comparable to Next.js (React) or Nuxt.js (Vue).  To explore the types of applications possible, refer to the project types documentation.\n\n### SvelteKit vs. Svelte\n\nSvelte excels at rendering UI components.  While you can build entire pages with Svelte alone, creating a full-fledged application requires more. SvelteKit addresses this by providing essential tools and best practices for building modern web apps.\n\nSvelteKit handles many complexities automatically, including:\n\n* Routing (UI updates on link clicks)\n* Build optimizations (loading only necessary code)\n* Offline support\n* Page preloading\n* Configurable rendering (SSR, client-side rendering, prerendering)\n* Image optimization\n\nThis framework significantly simplifies the development process, allowing you to focus on creativity.  The use of Vite with a Svelte plugin enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR), providing an exceptionally fast and responsive development experience.",
